Data science is developing in a world overwhelmed by information of all kinds. In biology, the increasing flow of data requires the mastery of tools to analyze them. The objective of courses, in the biology curriculum at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Mons in Belgium, is to train our students in techniques and best practices that will be an integral part of their future career in an open and reproducible science context.
